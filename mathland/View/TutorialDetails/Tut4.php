            <p class="myinfotext">Division is often associated with the keywords 'DIVIDED BY' or 'DIVIDE', for example I could say 'whats 8 DIVIDED BY 2 equal?'
                 or word it differently as 'If you DIVIDE 8 into 2 even parts, what does each part equal?'. In this Tutorial area Video Lessons are provided to help
                 learn the basics and beyond to more advanced methods of Division! Replay Tutorials as many times as needed until understood and capable
                 of going to the practice or game sections to put the knowledge learned into action and give your new Math Skills a go..

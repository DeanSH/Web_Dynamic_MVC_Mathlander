            <p class="myinfotext">Addition is often associated with the keywords 'PLUS' or 'ADD', for example I could say 'what does 4 PLUS 6 equal?'
                 or word it differently as 'If you ADD 6 to the number 4, what does it equal?'. In this Tutorial area Video Lessons are provided to help
                 learn the basics and beyond to more advanced methods of Addition! Replay Tutorials as many times as needed until understood and capable
                 of going to the practice or game sections to put the knowledge learned into action and give your new Math Skills a go..

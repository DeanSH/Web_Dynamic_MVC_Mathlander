# Web_Dynamic_MVC_Mathlander
This was a project I created for an course studied during my BIT that was aimed at helping my kids to learn Mathematics! Using the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, it dynamically displays page content, has register, login, competition entry form, pop-up you tube tutorials, JQuery Math Speed trainer &amp; separate Learner and Educator account types, profiles with editing, password changing and more!

## NOTES:
This was built using HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap4, JS, JQuery, PHP, Ajax and MySQL!
My kids have successfully used it to leanr Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division along with Speed Training.
With further work to complete elements not yet fully implementated this could be a great project for kids and educators world-wide.

The MySQL Matherlander.sql file has been provided, ScreenShots, and my Official Report documenting everything for this projects,
Database ERD design, Intended audience, competitive analysis, wireframing, and much more!

## How To Use:
Load the Mathlander project files into your localhost Web server or live hosting, and deploy the MySQL.sql, update the DBconnection.php file inside the Model folder to be able to successfuly connect and everything should then work fine.
